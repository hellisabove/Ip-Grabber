Author's Integrity License v 0.4
Copyright 2021 - Halphix

1. License
	IP-Graber is made available free of charge to any 
	Individual for personal use provided Limitations (Section 2) are observed.

	The Author hereby grants a license to any Creative to freely use, sample, remix, 
	or redistribute the Work provided Limitations (Section 2) are observed.

2. Limitations
	2.1 Redistribution Integrity
	    2.1.1 Redistribution of the Work is permitted, except in the following instances:
	    	• Linking to, embedding, re-uploading, or otherwise sharing the Work using thumbnails, headlines,
		  or body copy which mislead or Misrepresent the Work of the Author OR
      		• No omission of any part of the original Work has occurred. (See Section 2.2)
	2.2 Derivative Works
	    2.2.1 The Creative may sample portions of the Original Content except when Derivative works:
      		• Intentionally Misrepresent the Original Content OR
      		• Include Sponsored or Paid Content (in part or in full)
	2.3 Expressly Prohibited Usage
	    2.3.1 The use of the Work for the purpose of training neural networks, artificial
	    intelligence, computer learning algorithms, or voice recognition software (collectively, GANs) is
	    expressly forbidden.
      		  • Voice recognition software for the purpose of creating text transcripts
		    of the Work is allowed if:
          		◦ The terms of Derivative Works (Section 2.2) are met AND
          		◦ Training data are NOT stored AND

	    2.3.3 The inclusion of this section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of

3. Intent

      The purpose of this license is to preserve the integrity of the Author’s message, their
      intent, and the context of the Author’s protected Work.

      This license SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a means of shielding the Author or the Work
      from criticism, parody, satire, or other protected speech.

      The abuse thereof would constitute an UNAUTHORIZED REMIX of these terms (this document
      is recursively licensed) and would result in a nullification of Author’s right to apply
      these terms to their own Work.

      (See Section 2.2 Derivative Works)

4. Licensing
      The terms of this license apply to ALL Derivatives of this Work. Any Creative who makes a
      Derivative Work using the Original Content—or who Redistributes the Work—agrees to be
      bound by the terms laid out in this license.

      Failure to comply with these terms will result in the non-compliant Creative having their
      license to use the Work rescinded, past and future licenses from the same non-compliant
      Author nullified (at the original Author’s discretion), and possible legal action taken on
      behalf of the original Author.
